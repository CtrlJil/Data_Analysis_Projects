# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects, demonstrating my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling.

## Project Structure

The projects are organized into folders, each representing a separate analysis or case study.

* `Project_1_Sales_Analysis`: Analysis of sales data to identify trends and patterns.
* `Project_2_Customer_Segmentation`: Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms to target specific customer groups.
* `Project_3_Predictive_Modeling`: Development of a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
* `Project_4_Web_Scraping_and_Analysis`: Web scraping data, and then performing analysis on the resulting datasets.
* * etc...

## Key Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio showcases my proficiency in the following areas:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and summarizing data to gain insights.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating compelling visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Conducting statistical tests and interpreting results.
* **Machine Learning:** Building and evaluating predictive models using scikit-learn.
* **Python Programming:** Using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
* **Database interaction:** Utilizing SQL to query databases.

## Project Details

Each project folder contains the following:

* **Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts (.ipynb, .py):** The code used for the analysis.
* **Datasets (.csv, .xlsx, .json):** The data files used in the analysis.
* **`README.md`:** A detailed description of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, and results.
* **Visualizations (.png, .jpg):** Images of key charts and graphs.
* **Any supporting documents.**

## How to View Projects

To explore a specific project:

1.  Navigate to the project's folder within this repository.
2.  Open the corresponding `README.md` file for a detailed overview.
3.  View the Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) files to examine the code and analysis.
